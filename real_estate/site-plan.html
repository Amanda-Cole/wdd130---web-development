<br>PRO Tips * cards that flip to show tip*<br>
Buying and Investing
	Know what you need versus what you want.  I will always meet your needs, 
  and try to work my magic to get you what you dream of.
Approach property with the sense of making profit, 
not to see if it is up to your personal standards.

Selling
	Clean out every closet and store clutter under beds.  
  Showing a home that seems to have storage will appeal to more buyers.

        Steps for Buying – Tabs for each topic
        So you are ready to buy a house! What an exciting time in your life and I am 
        here to help you every step of the way.  Here are some steps that we need to
         take before we can really get going.<br>
         <br><br>Meet with Mortgage lender and get preapproved<br>
          Meeting with a Mortgage Lender is the first step in buying a home either for yourself,
           or as an investment.  Plan to have paystubs, tax returns, and other valid financial
            documents ready. Do Not make any major purchases or financial changes during this time.
             Once you have spoken to your Lender, and know what loan you are approved for and 
          comfortable with then we set a budget and start the process of looking for your new home.
          <br> <br>Confirm your Agent<br>
          I will ask you to sign a contract that states you have chosen me to be your Agent, 
          and for what time period. This is a step that protects me and you as we start the adventure of finding you a home.
          We will preview listings everyday, and then we will start going in person.
          Contract will be filled out and down payment collected.  Once the seller signs 
          then we are under Contract.  Then comes inspections and appraisals.

          <br>Steps for investing – Tabs
        Cash is king
          Cash is king when it comes to investment properties.  If you don’t have enough cash to
           purchase an investment property that’s ok!  Speak to a lender and they will help you understand what you can qualify for.  
          Leave your standards at home.  Understanding that an investment property is all about 
          making profit, and not about buying a home that you would personally live in is essential.  
          <br><br>Flip<br>
          Flipping a house means that you purchase it, remodel it, and then sell it for a profit. 
           This can be a great way to put your money to work but there are risks.  But watch the clock as time is money when flipping a house
          Buying a home and renting it out is a great long-term investment.  Rental rates have gone up 
          allowing investors an opportunity to make an additional monthly income. 
          <br><br>Emergency Money<br>
          Investment properties have a risk like all investments do.  I strongly encourage investors to
           keep 6 months of their property expenses on hand in case the renter can’t pay the rent or improvements need to be made.  
          Property Management companies list your rental, interview the candidates, do the background
           checks, show the property, handle the lease, collect the rent, handle repair requests, and 
           carryout the eviction process if necessary.  Check there fees and see which one is right for you.

        Steps for Selling Tabs<br>
        <br>Meet with Agent<br>
           Give me a call if you are looking to sell your home.  We can talk about the market and what
            is a realistic price for your home.
            I will guide you in determining if making improvements would be beneficial.
            <br><br>Preparing for showings<br>
          Start cleaning and decluttering.  Homes show the best when they feel large and clean.
                 Once you are ready we will list your property and the showings will begin.  If we do not have 
          at least 5 showings a week, then we will need to reexamine the price and the overall appeal to buyers.  
          <br><br>Contract<br>
          Once an offer is received we will review and answer all questions.  Then we can move forward to closing.
          As a seller you do have to pay some fees.  Closing costs on your side will be around 2% of your 
          sales prices.  Also you have to pay the buyers agent 3% of sales price, but I will charge you only $1500 to sell your home.
