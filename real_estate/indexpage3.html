                    <h4>Meet Amanda Cole</h4>
                    <p> I have been a Realtor for 9 years.  
                    I am the mom of 4 children and someone who loves to take chances.  
                    Change is exciting to me and I love to think outside the box. 
                    I have called Utah my home for 24 years and I know Salt Lake County very well. 
                    I am experienced in buying, selling, and Investments.

                <h2>Ready to Sell?</h2>
                <p>Give me a call if you are looking to sell your home.
                    We can talk about the market and what is a realistic price 
                    for your home. I will guide you in determining if making 
                    improvements would be beneficial.

                <h2>Prepare for Showings</h2>
                <p> Start cleaning and decluttering. Homes show the best when they feel 
                    large and clean. Once you are ready we will list your property and 
                    the showings will begin. If we do not have at least 5 showings a week,
                    then we will need to reexamine the price and the overall appeal to buyers.

                <h2>Receiving an offer</h2>
                <p>Once an offer is received we will review and answer all questions. 
                    Then we can move forward to closing. As a seller you do have to pay
                    some fees. Closing costs on your side will be around .5% of your 
                    sales price. Also you have to pay the buyers agent 3% of sales 
                    price, but I will charge you only $1500 to sell your home.</p>
