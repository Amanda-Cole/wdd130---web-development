                <h2>Meet with Mortgage lender and get preapproved </h2>
                <p> Meeting with a Mortgage Lender is the first step in buying a home either for yourself,
                     or as an investment. Plan to have paystubs, tax returns, and other valid financial
                      documents ready. Do Not make any major purchases or financial changes during this time. 
                      Once you have spoken to your Lender, and know what loan you are approved for and comfortable
                       with then we set a budget and start the process of looking for your new home.</p>

                <h2>Confirm your Agent</h2>
                <p>I will ask you to sign a contract that states you have chosen me to be your Agent, 
                    and for what time period. This is a step that protects me and you as we start the
                    adventure of finding you a home. We will preview listings everyday, and then we
                    will start going in person. Contract will be filled out and down payment collected. 
                    Once the seller signs then we are under Contract. Then comes inspections and appraisals.</p>

                <h2>Thinking of an Investment Property?</h2>
                <p>Cash is king when it comes to investment properties. If you don’t have enough
                    cash to purchase an investment property that’s ok! Speak to a lender and they
                    will help you understand what you can qualify for. Leave your standards at home.
                    Understanding that an investment property is all about making profit, and not
                    about buying a home that you would personally live in is essential.

                <h2>Flipping vs. Renting</h2>
                <p>Flipping a house means that you purchase it, remodel it, and then sell it for a profit. 
                    This can be a great way to put your money to work but there are risks. But watch the 
                    clock as time is money when flipping a house Buying a home and renting it out is a great
                    long-term investment. Rental rates have gone up allowing investors an opportunity to
                    make an additional monthly income.</p>

                <h2>Emergency Money</h2>
                <p>Investment properties have a risk like all investments do. I strongly encourage investors 
                    to keep 6 months of their property expenses on hand in case the renter can’t pay the rent
                    or improvements need to be made. Property Management companies list your rental, interview
                    the candidates, do the background checks, show the property, handle the lease, collect the 
                    rent, handle repair requests, and carryout the eviction process if necessary. Check there
                    fees and see which one is right for you.</p>
