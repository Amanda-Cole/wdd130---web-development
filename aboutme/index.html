    <h2>Amanda Cole</h2>
  
    <p>Hi everyone.  I am Amanda Cole and I have never built or designed a website. </p>
    In fact I started learning python 4 months ago so writing code is new to me. I have been
    married for 21 years and we have four children ages 18-11. I am currently a Realtor and 
    an account manager for a property management company.</p>
    <p>I am persuing a Bachelors Degree in Professional Studies with an emphasis on Computer Programming
    and Business Management. It is my hope to get a job as a project manager.</p>
    <p>I believe that knowing and understanding web design will be valuable because I would like to build my own 
    Real Estate website, and also be able to build and maintain the main website for my Broker.</p>
    <p>My husband and I would like to be able to serve a full time mission when we retire so together we are 
    working and saving for that opportunity.</p>
